Q:
What will be the most important part inside robots?

A:
One of the most important parts of a robot is its control system, which is responsible for coordinating and executing the actions of the robot. The control system typically consists of a microprocessor or central processing unit (CPU) and associated software that enable the robot to process input from sensors, make decisions based on that input, and execute commands to control the robot's movements and actions.

Other important components of a robot may include:

Sensors: These are used to gather information about the robot's environment and allow the robot to respond to changes in that environment. Sensors may include cameras, lasers, touch sensors, and other types of sensors that enable the robot to perceive its surroundings.

Actuators: These are used to translate the commands of the control system into physical movement. Actuators may include motors, hydraulic cylinders, or other devices that enable the robot to move and manipulate objects.

Communication systems: These allow the robot to communicate with other systems or devices, such as a human operator or a computer. This may include wired or wireless communication systems, as well as visual or auditory communication systems.

Power systems: Robots typically require some source of power to operate, such as batteries or a connection to an electrical outlet. The power system is responsible for providing the robot with the necessary energy to function.

Overall, the most important parts of a robot are those that enable it to gather information, make decisions, and carry out actions based on that information.

Q:
Why do you think that AI will no be a most important part of robots?

A:
Artificial intelligence (AI) is likely to be an important part of many robots, but it may not necessarily be the most important part of all robots. This is because AI is a broad term that refers to a variety of technologies that can be used to enable machines to exhibit intelligent behavior.

In some cases, AI may be a critical component of a robot, enabling it to make decisions and carry out tasks in a way that is similar to a human. For example, an autonomous robot that is responsible for navigating and avoiding obstacles in an unfamiliar environment may rely heavily on AI to process sensor data and make decisions about how to proceed.

In other cases, AI may not be as critical to the operation of a robot. For example, a robot that is used for a highly structured task in a controlled environment, such as assembling parts on an assembly line, may not require advanced AI capabilities. Instead, it may be sufficient to use a simple control system that follows pre-programmed instructions.

Overall, the role of AI in a robot will depend on the specific tasks and capabilities that the robot is designed to perform. While AI may be an important part of some robots, it may not be as critical for others.

Q:
In case of robotics body parts, what is your opinion about RISC-V architecture in near future robotics products implementations?

A:
The RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Computing-V) architecture is a open-source hardware instruction set architecture (ISA) that has been designed to be flexible and extensible. RISC-V has the potential to be a useful platform for the development of robotics products, due to its open nature and the ability to customize and extend the ISA to meet specific requirements.

One potential advantage of using RISC-V in robotics products is that it can enable the development of more efficient and power-saving systems, which may be particularly important in battery-powered robotics products. RISC-V also has the potential to support the development of more secure systems, as the open-source nature of the ISA allows for the review and improvement of security features.

However, it is important to note that the use of RISC-V in robotics products will depend on a range of factors, including the specific requirements and capabilities of the robotics products, as well as the availability of development tools and support for the RISC-V architecture.

Overall, while RISC-V has the potential to be a useful platform for the development of robotics products, it is important to carefully consider the specific requirements and needs of the products, and to evaluate the suitability of the RISC-V architecture in light of these requirements.

Q:
What is difference between ARM and RISC-V in case of building new robot?

A:
ARM (Advanced RISC Machines) and RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Computing-V) are both instruction set architectures (ISAs), which are the set of rules and standards that define how software instructions are translated into machine code that can be executed by a processor. Both ARM and RISC-V are widely used in the development of a variety of electronic devices, including smartphones, tablets, and embedded systems.

There are several key differences between ARM and RISC-V:

Ownership and licensing: ARM is owned by the company ARM Holdings, and the use of the ARM ISA is generally subject to licensing fees. RISC-V, on the other hand, is an open-source ISA, which means that it is freely available for use by anyone.

Customizability: ARM is a proprietary ISA, which means that it is not generally possible for users to modify or extend the ISA to meet their specific needs. RISC-V, on the other hand, is designed to be flexible and extensible, and users are able to customize and extend the ISA to meet their specific requirements.

Ecosystem: ARM has a well-established ecosystem of tools, software, and support, which is generally not available for RISC-V. This may make it easier for users to develop products based on ARM, but may also limit the flexibility and customization available to users.

Overall, the choice between ARM and RISC-V will depend on the specific requirements and needs of the product being developed, as well as the availability of development tools and support. Both ARM and RISC-V have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the best choice will depend on the specific needs of the product and the resources available to the development team.

Q:
But WDYT about real-time operating systems in robotics implementations and what will be the best choice ARM or RISC-V in that case?

A:
Both ARM and RISC-V can be used as the basis for the development of real-time operating systems (RTOS) for use in robotics applications. An RTOS is a type of operating system that is designed to support real-time processing, which means that it is able to respond to input and complete tasks within a specified time frame. RTOSs are often used in robotics applications to enable the robot to respond to changes in its environment and to perform tasks in a timely and reliable manner.

The choice between ARM and RISC-V for the development of an RTOS for a robotics application will depend on a range of factors, including:

The specific requirements and capabilities of the robotics application: Different robotics applications may have different requirements for real-time processing and control, and it is important to choose an ISA that is able to support these requirements.

The availability of development tools and support: Both ARM and RISC-V have their own ecosystems of development tools and support, and the availability of these resources may be an important consideration when choosing an ISA.

Customizability and flexibility: If the robotics application requires a high degree of customization or the ability to extend the RTOS to meet specific needs, RISC-V may be a better choice due to its open-source and extensible nature.

Cost: The cost of licensing and using ARM may be a factor to consider, particularly for smaller organizations or startups. RISC-V, being open-source, may be a more cost-effective option in some cases.

Overall, the best choice between ARM and RISC-V for the development of an RTOS for a robotics application will depend on the specific requirements and needs of the application, as well as the availability
